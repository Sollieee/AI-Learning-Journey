NLP Text Preprocessing Series: 

Lowercasing üî°
Welcome to the first step in my NLP Text Preprocessing Series‚ÄîLowercasing!

üåü Why lowercasing matters
When working with text data, "Cat" and "cat" are treated as different words by machine learning models. Lowercasing ensures consistency by converting all text to lowercase, making it easier to clean and analyze.
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Be mindful‚Äîlowercasing can alter meaning, like "US" (United States) vs. "us" (you and me).

üè∑Ô∏è Let‚Äôs break down the code!
1Ô∏è‚É£ Lowercasing a sentence:
Python
sentence = "Her cat's name is Luna"
lower_sentence = sentence.lower()
print(lower_sentence)
Explanation:
sentence.lower() converts all characters to lowercase.
The result is stored in lower_sentence.
Output:
her cat's name is luna


2Ô∏è‚É£ Lowercasing multiple sentences:
sentence_list = ['Could you pass me the TV remote?', 
                 'It is IMPOSSIBLE to find this hotel', 
                 'Want to go for dinner on Tuesday?']

lower_sentence_list = [x.lower() for x in sentence_list]
print(lower_sentence_list)

Why use this method?
The .lower() method works on strings (like a single sentence), but it doesn‚Äôt work directly on lists [].
To lowercase all sentences in a list, we use a list comprehension ‚Äî a concise way to apply a function to every item in a list:
for x in sentence_list iterates through each sentence.
x.lower() converts each sentence to lowercase.
The results are collected into a new list: lower_sentence_list.
It‚Äôs a cleaner, more efficient alternative to using a traditional for loop like this:
lower_sentence_list = []
for sentence in sentence_list:
lower_sentence_list.append(sentence.lower())

Output:
['could you pass me the tv remote?', 
 'it is impossible to find this hotel', 
 'want to go for dinner on tuesday?']


‚úÖ Key takeaway
Lowercasing brings consistency to text data, preparing it for further cleaning and modeling.
